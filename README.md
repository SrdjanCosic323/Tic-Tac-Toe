# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Developed a single player command-line-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using the C programming language,
which also includes saving the winning scores for the player and the computer, using a dynamic
character array to store players' marks on the board.
â€¢ Afterwards, I have restructured the code using C++, employing Object-Oriented Programming principles.
